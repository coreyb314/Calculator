# Calculator
This is a calculator implemented 'from scratch' in C++

It is incomplete, but the following functionality is available:

  Linear Algebra
    Enter and Print Matrices
    
  Arithmetic
    Addition, subtraction, multiplication, division
    Exponentiation, remainders, factorial
    Trigonometric expressions
    Logarithms 
    
  This calculator is capable of parsing many-fuctioned inputs with sufficient use of brackets. 
  
  Use:
    To enter linear algebra mode, type 'LinAlg.' To enter algebra mode, typle 'Alg.'
	  
    Use the following formats for entering algebraic expressions:
      A+B		A-B		A*B		A/B		A^B		A%B		A!
      sin(B)		cos(B)		tan(B)		sec(B)		csc(B)		cot(B)
      log_A(B)	ln(B)" << endl;
    
    Order of operations is not automatic - use brackets.
        No brackets are necessary around entire expressions
    
    Linear Algebra Instructions:
      To enter a matrix, seperate entries with commas and rows with semicolons.
      Please ensure all rows are of equal length.
      For instance, a 3X3 matrix will have the entry form 'a,b,c;d,e,f;g,h,i;'
